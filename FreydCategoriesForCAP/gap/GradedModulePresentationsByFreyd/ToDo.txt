@Martin:

* Implement the necessary methods for FpGradedModules into FreydCategory and send Sepp pull requests for each of these
     - Aim: functionality of toric sheaves applicable with FpGradedModules
     - Functors:
          - Twist
     - Ideals:
          - in particular Frobenius powers
     - Minimal free resolution + Betti table (think about data type of the output)

@Sepp:

* Write down the idea of an implementation for the Homomorphism-Structure in GrRows/GrCols

* Implement InternalHom and Tensorproduct for category of rows

* Implement InternalHom and Tensorproduct for category of columns

@Both:

* Take a look at the docu issue
