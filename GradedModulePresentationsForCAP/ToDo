(1) Immediate methods to trigger "LessGenerators" and "StandardModule" at certain places to simplify computations.
(2) Get computations done faster, so that they compare to what GradedModules does in performance respects.
(3) "Copy" the entire GradedModules into category theory setting, in particular using the same function names?
(4) Add GAP category for "MinimalFreeResolution" and then write a "FullInformation" method

(5) do more advance computation with GS or DirectProducts -> recursion depth trap -> investigate
