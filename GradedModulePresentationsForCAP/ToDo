(1) I do not trust "LessGenerators". In particular this "SimplerMatrix" method is quite mysterious.
    -> Do it properly? Why is the transformation_triple homogeneous?
(2) Immediate methods to trigger "LessGenerators" and "StandardModule" at certain places to simplify computations.
(3) Get computations done faster, so that they compare to what GradedModules does in performance respects.
(4) "Copy" the entire GradedModules into category theory setting, in particular using the same function names?
